Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting calories burnt based on various physiological and activity-related factors. The prediction model utilizes supervised learning techniques to analyze input data and estimate the calories burnt during physical activities.

Features
Dataset: Includes a comprehensive dataset collected from wearable fitness devices and health trackers, capturing factors such as heart rate, duration of activity, type of exercise, and personal attributes (age, weight, etc.).
Preprocessing: Detailed data preprocessing steps including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.
Model Selection: Experimentation with multiple machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks to determine the best-performing model.
Evaluation: Performance evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) used to assess the accuracy of the prediction models.
Deployment: Example scripts or notebooks demonstrating how to deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.
